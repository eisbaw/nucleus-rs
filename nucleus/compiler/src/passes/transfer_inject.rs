//! Transfer injection — TASK-0018.
//!
//! For every dataflow edge that crosses worker entities, insert a
//! matched pair of [`ACFGNode::Xfer`] placeholders carrying
//! [`XferRole::Push`] (on the producer's prior position) and
//! [`XferRole::Wait`] (immediately before the consumer). Both
//! endpoints share a fresh, unique [`SeqTag`] and the
//! [`TransferPolicy`] resolved from `LinkedIR.sched.transfers`.
//!
//! See PRD §6.3.4 (transfer directives), §8.3 (Push/Wait/seq), and
//! TASK-0018 for the contract this implements.
//!
//! ## Inputs and outputs
//!
//! Pure function:
//!
//! ```text
//! inject_transfers : (&LinkedIR, ACFG) -> ACFG
//! ```
//!
//! `&LinkedIR` is needed because:
//!
//! - `linked.data_producers` / `linked.data_consumers` tell us where
//!   each data symbol lives, so we know which dataflow edges cross
//!   workers.
//! - `linked.sched.transfers` tells us the policy declared in the
//!   schedule. Per the task spec, capability validation (e.g. async
//!   on a sync-only backend) is deferred — we just thread the policy
//!   through onto each [`XferPlaceholder`].
//!
//! The `ACFG` is consumed and a new ACFG is returned; the name-table
//! maps are forwarded unchanged.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! Walk the tree recursively. Maintain a per-data "last known producer
//! worker" map; the link pass tells us each data symbol has at most
//! one producer kernel (single-assignment, PRD §6.2.1), so the
//! producer worker entity for `D` is uniquely identified by the
//! schedule's placement of that kernel.
//!
//! For every [`ACFGNode::Operation`] node O on consumer worker entity
//! `W_c` that reads data `D`:
//!
//! 1. Look up `D`'s producer worker entity `W_p` via
//!    `linked.data_producers`. If absent (e.g. top-level
//!    `load_image` result whose producer entity is the loader's
//!    placement — also recorded in `data_producers`) we skip.
//! 2. If `W_p == W_c`, nothing to inject (intra-worker transfer).
//! 3. Otherwise, allocate a fresh `SeqTag`, build a Push placeholder
//!    on the (src, dst, data, tile, policy) tuple, and a matching
//!    Wait. Insert the Wait immediately before O in O's enclosing
//!    sequence; insert the Push immediately after the producer's
//!    Operation. The producer Operation is located by a parallel
//!    walk that remembers, per data symbol, where it was last
//!    written.
//!
//! Worker entities in the link pass are `BTreeSet<String>` (a kernel
//! can be placed on multiple workers — `place k on {w0,w1,w2,w3}`).
//! The ACFG carries `BTreeSet<WorkerId>` on each Operation. Both sides
//! collapse the same way — we use the BTreeSet equality directly
//! when deciding "same entity?".
//!
//! For the `src` and `dst` fields on [`XferPlaceholder`] we need *a*
//! `WorkerId`, not a set. We pick the lexicographically-first worker
//! in the entity's BTreeSet as the canonical representative. This is
//! a known simplification — see "Honest limitations" below.
//!
//! ## Honest limitations (recorded for follow-up)
//!
//! - **Distributed placements treated as a single entity.** The link
//!   pass already collapses `place k on {w0,w1,w2,w3}` into one
//!   `WorkerEntity`. Transfer injection inherits this: a transfer
//!   between `host` and `{w0..w3}` becomes one Push/Wait pair, not
//!   four; the canonical `src`/`dst` we record is the BTreeSet's
//!   first element. A future partition pass (TASK-0016+) will
//!   replicate the pair across the named workers per the partition
//!   policy.
//!
//! - **Per-point granularity.** When the consumer is inside a `for`,
//!   we currently fire one Push/Wait per *iteration* (per Operation
//!   visit). The producer for an `outer <-- load_input()` placed on
//!   `host` therefore gets *one* Push for every consuming iteration
//!   that crosses worker, even though a real backend would aggregate
//!   into one bulk send. The IterTile we record is the consumer
//!   Operation's enclosing-loop tile. Tile-coalescing is a follow-up.
//!
//! - **Idempotence by structural skip.** Re-running the pass detects
//!   that a Wait already precedes the consumer Operation (and a Push
//!   already follows the producer Operation) by checking sibling
//!   `Xfer` nodes carrying the same `(src, dst, data, tile)`. It
//!   does NOT re-derive `seq` to be the same — the original
//!   placeholder is left in place. Tests cover this.
//!
//! - **No conflict detection between `sync` and `async` options on
//!   one directive.** If the schedule wrote `transfer D : sync, async;`,
//!   the last option in source order wins for the `synchronous` flag.
//!   The schedule lowering pass already flags this as a follow-up
//!   linker concern (grammar §2 note 7); we mirror that choice here.
//!
//! - **Capability check deferred.** Per the task spec, the backend
//!   isn't chosen at this point. We carry the schedule's stated
//!   policy onto every placeholder; codegen-time TASK-0019+ rejects
//!   `async`/`buffer>1`/`notify=event` against backends whose
//!   `capabilities.toml` doesn't list them.
